A fun Halloween-themed shooter game.
The enemies are clipart. The main character was drawn by me.

# How to Play
You are a marble trying to avoid and shoot enemies.
Use WASD to move, and use the arrow keys to shoot. You can shoot in all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. Press Escape to pause, and Escape or Enter to unpause.
If you get hit, you lose a life. After being hit, there are a few frames of invincibility. Every few seconds, 1-5 more enemies will spawn at the edges of the map. If you lose all your lives, the game ends.

Enjoy!

## Known Issues
Going into an edge will occasionally throw you off the screen with no way to return.
