a fun halloween-themed game

# How to Play
You are a spiral shooting Halloween stuff. Yeah.
WASD to move, arrow keys to shoot. If you get hit, you lose a life. After being hit, there are a few frames of invincibility. Every few seconds, 1-5 more enemies will spawn at the edges of the map. If you lose all your lives, you lose, but you can still keep playing after that.

## Known Issues
Going into an edge will occasionally throw you off the screen with no way to return.
