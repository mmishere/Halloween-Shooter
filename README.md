a fun halloween-themed game

# How to Play
You are a spiral shooting Halloween stuff. Yeah.
WASD to move, arrow keys to shoot. If you get hit, you lose a life, and if you lose all your lives, you lose.


## Known Issues
Going into an edge will occasionally throw you off the screen with no way to return.
Points don't work.
